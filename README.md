To reproduce the graphs from Crooks et al. - "The co-condensation of semi-volatile organics onto multiple aerosol particle modes" you need to copy all files in this folder into seperate Matlab scripts and save with the same file name. 

The two wrapper scripts can be run to produce the graphs that the name would suggest. Note that these graphs may have been edited in order to produce the exact graphs in the paper, or the wrapper scripts run more than one with manually changed parameter values. 

The code that solves explicitly the equations presented in the paper are contained within the file SOA_condensed_multiple_mode_fast_from_given_vapour and an example call of just this function is given at the start of the file. Alternatively, the parameter values can be changed in one of the wrapper scripts and those files run instead.
